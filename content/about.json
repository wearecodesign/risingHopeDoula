  "intro": "My journey to becoming a doula began with my own birth experience. I learned firsthand how powerful it is to have continuous, compassionate support during such a vulnerable time. That experience ignited my passion for helping other families feel informed, empowered, and held.\n\nAs a certified doula, I provide evidence-based, non-judgmental support that honors your unique needs and choices. Whether you're planning a home birth, hospital birth, medicated or unmedicated — I'm here to support your vision for your birth experience.\n\nMy approach is rooted in the belief that every birthing person deserves to feel safe, respected, and supported. I combine practical knowledge with emotional presence, offering comfort measures, advocacy support, and a calm, reassuring presence throughout your journey.\n\nBeyond birth support, I'm passionate about postpartum care. The fourth trimester is a profound transition, and families deserve nurturing support as they adjust to life with a new baby. I'm here to help you navigate this beautiful time."
