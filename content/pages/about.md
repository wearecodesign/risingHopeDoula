I'm a certified doula supporting families through pregnancy, birth, and the postpartum period. My approach is evidence-based, trauma-informed, and centered on your choices and comfort.

I believe every family deserves to feel informed, respected, and held during one of life's biggest transitions. Whether you're planning a hospital birth, home birth, or something in between, I'm here to help you prepare and to support you on the day.
